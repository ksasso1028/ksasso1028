I've been working on cutting-edge audio AI systems and tools, including:

ðŸŽµ LoopMagic - A text-to-audio generation system trained on the IllMind catalog, enabling creators to generate high-quality audio loops from text descriptions.

ðŸ”§ AI Declipper & Deverb Tools - Developed advanced audio restoration algorithms that shipped in FL Studio 25, helping producers clean up and enhance their audio with AI-powered processing.

ðŸš€ Current Projects - Currently collaborating with Image-Line (creators of FL Studio) on several exciting upcoming features and tools.
