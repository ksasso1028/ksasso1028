### Independent ML consultant working across comptuer vision, audio ML DSP, and biosignals
Recently, I designed and shipped the AI declipper which just released in [Fl Studio 21.1](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/editortool_clean.htm#declip) 

Currently continuing ML research into audio restoration/separation, video search, and video generation.

Active [warper](https://github.com/Sxela/WarpFusion),  may release some custom tools associated 🤔


Open to collaborations and commissions on ML work
