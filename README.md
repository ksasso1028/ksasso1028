**Independent ML consultant... playing with knobs across computer vision, audio ML DSP, and biosignals**

Recently, I designed and shipped the text to audio model powering [LoopMagic](https://www.loopmagic.com/) which is trained on !llmind's hip hop production catalog. Also recently designed and shipped the AI declipper for FL Studio, which just released in [FL Studio 2024](https://www.image-line.com/blog/fl-studio-2024-is-here/)
